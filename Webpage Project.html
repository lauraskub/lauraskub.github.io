	<p style="color:white">The modern fancy rat originates from the brown rat, or <i>rattus novegicus</i>. Fancy rats were originally domesticated in Europe by a man known as Jack Black, a renowned rat catcher hired by Queen Victoria. Jack began keeping the rats he found with more interesting colors and training them to perform tricks to impress customers. He began training the rats with more desirable coat colors, and selling them to female clients as pets. It's even rumored that he sold rats to queen Victoria as pets. Although rats did not remain as popular, they have become an increasingly popular pet across the globe. Rats now come in many colors, color patterns, ear patterns, and fur patterns, such as white, cinnamon, fawn, dumbo, standard, curly, long-haired, or even hairless.</p>

	<p style="color:white">Rats popularity has grown significantly in recent years, with the American Pet Products Association reporting that about half a million families own a rat or mouse, double the number since 2006. Rats are incredibly intelligent, clean, and loving. Rats produce a clicking noise referred to as "bruxing" when they are feeling happy. Bruxing is a result of rats clicking their teeth together quickly, which is also a behavior they perform to trim their teeth down. A recent study actually found that rats enjoyed being tickled, and produce a laughing sound at a frequence inaudible to humans. I intend to change your existing opinions on rats by providing a brief list of their amazing qualities.</p>

		<h1 style="color:white">1. Intelligence</h1>
	<p style="color:white">Rats are incredibly intelligent creatures, often referred to as having the mental capacity of a human toddler. Pet rats can be trained to use a litter box, recognize, respond, and come to their own names, and thousands of other tricks. Rats are often used in lab research because of their innate ability to learn complex tasks quickly. Rats can even be trained to fetch you a tissue, put a ring on your finger for you, or put a tiny basketball through a hoop. Here's a list of tricks that I have taught my rats in less than 30 minutes:</p>
	<table align="center">
		<tr>
			<th>Trick Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Come</th>
			<th>I first taught my rats to respond to a clicking noise I made, similar to a clicker used in dog training. Then I taught them to respond specifically to their names so I could call them each individually.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Climb</th>
			<th>I taught my rats to climb from the floor, up my leg, up my side, and onto my shoulder</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Spin</th>
			<th>This trick entails training your rat to turn their entire body in a circle. I taught mine by leading them in a circle with a treat, and they learned this trick in about 5 minutes.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Paw</th>
			<th>This trick involves teaching your rats to place their paw onto your finger on command. This trick also serves as the starting point for many other, more complex tricks. It can also be used as "targeting", although some trainers prefer to train their rats to place their nose on a target, rather than their paw.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Jump</th>
			<th>This trick has two different forms that my rats can perform. The first version I taught, I trained them to jump from the floor into my elevated hand. The other version, I taught them to jump off of the top of their cage or my dresser into my hands.</th>
		</tr>

	<p style="color:white">While my rats know several more tricks, and the tricks you can potentially teach them are endless, these tricks are some basic examples. All of these tricks took under 30 minutes to teach, and my rats were very eager to learn.</p>
